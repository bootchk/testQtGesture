A testbed for Qt gestures.  Written in Python using PyQt so it is easy to change.  

A gestural GUI is so horribly complex that you need a reduced example for testing. This is a testbed in the sense: you don't understand something, for example Qt documentation or Qt behavior.  You want a minimal app, harnessed to log to a console.  This is a minimal, easy-to-change Qt app that can subscribe to Qt defined gestures and a few minimal custom gesture recognizers. It logs many events, for example, all seen by custom recognizers, and all gesture events seen by a typical app top-level window. 

Example questions I tried to answer with this testbed:

-Can you get single touch events from an Apple Trackpad on OSX using Qt (No, apparently the driver doesn't deliver them in raw form.)

-Are any Qt defined gestures generated on Linux without a touch device (Yes, apparently TapAndHold is generated for mouse buttons, both left and right.  But no other gestures.)

-Exactly what QGestureEvents are generated for each result returned by a QGestureRecognizer? (I intend to post the answer elsewhere.)

- Does a grabbed gesture that starts in the app get events once the pointer leaves the app's top-level windows? (Yes.)

- What is a GestureOverride event and what is the interaction between child and parent windows regarding gestures?  (???)

- What complexity does QGraphicsFramework and QGraphicsView add to gestures? (???)

- Are certain touch devices well supported for gestures in apps on Ubuntu (??? For example a Wacom Babmoo PenAndTouch doesn't behave as I expected: doesn't deliver single touch events at least in my configuration.)
